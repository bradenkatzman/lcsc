	<h3>Program Planning</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>On average, DD students take 6 classes per semester (if you’re lucky, you’ll eventually only have to take 5. Occasionally a DD will take 7)</li>
		<li>Each semester, you are either full-time at Barnard and part-time JTS, or full-time JTS and part-time Barnard.</li>
		<li>For the school at which you’re part-time, you’ll be paying by the credit</li>
		<li>To relieve some of the financial burden that comes from paying by the credit, many DD students plan their schedule lopsided – 5 classes at one school and only 1 class at the other.</li>
		<li>Also to relieve the financial burden, you might want to try to take lab science and PE classes when you are full-time at Barnard so that you don’t have to pay for extra credits while you’re part-time</li>
		<li>Exact fees change from year to year</li>
		<li>Deciding which school at which to be full-time is different for each student. Most DDs choose to be full-time JTS in the Fall because it makes it much easier to deal with the holidays (less Barnard/Columbia work to make up)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Program Planning at Barnard</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>During the first year most Double Degrees take three Barnard classes their first semester and four or five in their second</li>
		<li>If you don’t know what you want to major in, try to start taking as many classes as you can that fulfill your Nine Ways of Knowing. Information about the Nine Ways can be found <a href="http://barnard.edu/provost/teaching/GER" target="_blank">here</a></li>
		<li>Nine Ways that are fulfilled by the JTS core:
			<ul>
				<li>Language</li>
				<li>Historical Studies</li>
				<li>Literature</li>
				<li>Ethics and Value</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If you took a class at JTS to fulfill one of these Nine Ways and it has not shown up on your Barnard transcript under your degree audit, you may have to petition to get that class to count.  Email your Barnard advisor and cc’ your JTS advisor to inquire about the missing class to make sure it isn’t a clerical error.  If the class has not been approved, you need to fill out this <a href="http://barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/studentappealform_2.pdf" target="_blank">form</a></li>
		<li>If you do know what you want to major in OR you are in a specific track (like pre-med) start taking required classes as soon as you want/can</li>
		<li>If you don’t know what you want to major in don’t worry, it’s very possible one of your Nine Ways classes will be so amazing that you’ll find your major!</li>
		<li>You have until the second semester of your sophomore year to declare your major</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Program Planning at JTS</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Think ahead!  When you plan your Fall Schedule at JTS, you can see what they’re offering in the Spring.  Use this information to make informed decisions, as some classes (or departments) may only have classes for your level once a year.</li>
		<li>Work on your Hebrew requirements right away</li>
		<li>If you only have a few semesters left or place out then you can start taking classes for your core requirement. You can take any of the intro classes that you want, and sometimes you can go straight into a more advanced level. This will depend on your background, so discuss with your adviser. A list of JTS core requirements can be found <a href="http://jtsa.edu/List_College_(Undergraduate)/Academics/Core_Curriculum.xml" target="_blank">here</a></li>
		<li>If you have to start below Hebrew Intermediate one: As you take Hebrew classes, you can take literature, Jewish thought, and history classes to start fulfilling your core requirements</li>
		<li>Don’t worry about figuring out your major, you don’t have to declare your major until fall semester Junior year</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Tuition and Financial Aid</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>You will receive separate bills from Barnard and JTS</li>
		<li>To be considered for financial aid, you ￼￼￼￼must apply to both programs for aid and ￼submit all required documents to the respective schools</li>
		<li>As you program plan each semester, Barnard Financial Aid should contact you to try to estimate how many credits you’ll be taking. If your schedule changes, your financial aid will be adjusted. It’s a good idea to contact the financial aid office yourself when you make these changes, just to make sure.</li>
		<li>If you receive Barnard financial aid, you are eligible for a Barnard grant as long as the total number of credits you take at both schools is over 12 (which it definitely will be). This means that you are still eligible even when you are part- time at Barnard</li>
		<li>JTS offers a variety of merit awards. If you receive a merit award, the job and loan portion of your Barnard aid package will be reduced. This is the same policy as for other outside scholarships. (It is always in your interest to receive outside scholarships.)</li>
		<li>Your housing will affect your financial aid packages from both schools, so if you consider switching between Barnard and JTS housing, or moving off campus, make sure to contact the financial aid offices to find out how your aid package will be affected.</li>
		<li>Barnard only offers financial aid for 8 semesters (4 years). After 8 semesters, you will only be eligible for financial aid from JTS.</li>
		<li>More information about Barnard’s financial aid policies can be found <a href="http://barnard.edu/finaid/jewish-theological-seminary-double-degree-program" target="_blank">here</a></li>
		<li>More information about JTS financial aid policies can be found <a href="http://www.jtsa.edu/Academics/Registrar/Financial_Aid.xml" target="_blank">here</a></li>
		<li>Both Barnard and JTS have various job and work-study options, and some of them are really fun!</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Housing</h3>
	<p class="center"> As a Double Degree, you have the option to live either in Barnard housing or JTS housing (You may also choose to live off-campus). The following information breaks down the different traits of each housing system.</p>

	<h4>Barnard Housing</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Barnard first-years live in the quad, with 1-3 roommate(s).  In the quad, there is a kitchen on each floor, with ovens on every other floor.  Quad kitchens do not include refrigerators, so most first-years buy or rent a mini-fridge.  It’s a good idea to get in touch with your roommate ahead of time, as you can probably share a mini-fridge with her.</li>
		<li>In the following three years, Barnard students apply for housing through the lottery, which occurs in the middle of spring semester each year.  There are several different housing options, ranging from dormitories to apartment suites, with both singles and doubles. Some buildings are air-conditioned and have controlled heating, while others do not.  Detailed descriptions of housing options can be found at http://barnard.edu/reslife/housing-options. </li>
		<li>In sophomore, junior, and senior years, you may create a housing group for the lottery that includes both Barnard and Columbia students.  If the majority of students in your group are Columbia students, you will live in Columbia housing.  Barnard and Columbia allow co-ed housing.</li>
		<li>Barnard guarantees housing for 4 consecutive years.  If you take a leave of absence or choose to live elsewhere for a period of time, you will not necessarily be re-admitted into Barnard housing.  Transfer students are not guaranteed housing.</li>
		<li>All Barnard housing options security guards 24 hours a day.</li>
		<li>You may sign in up to 2 non-Barnard students to your dorm at a time.</li>
		<li>Most Barnard housing buildings include a computer lab with printers.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><a href="http://barnard.edu/reslife" target="_blank">Barnard Residential Life & Housing</a></p>

	<h4>JTS Housing</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>List College students live in Goldsmith, an apartment building on 121st and Broadway. Apartments are shared among 3-5 people, each of whom live in a single room. Apartments are single-sex. Goldsmith is not air-conditioned, though students may choose to purchase air conditioning for about $50.</li>
		<li>2 Jewish Life Directors (JLD’s) plan religious programming in Goldsmith.  (Note: Double Degrees who live in Barnard housing are still invited to this programming)</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Off-Campus Housing</h4>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bayit/" target="_blank">The Bayit</a> is is Columbia/Barnard’s Jewish Food Co-op</li>
		<li>Some Greek organizations provide <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/resprograms/fraternity_sorority" target="_blank">housing</a> for members:</li>
		<li>For various reasons, some sophomore, junior, and senior students choose to rent apartments off campus.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Study Abroad</h3>
	<p>By the time you’re actively working on going abroad, you will be the master of both Barnard and JTS bureaucracy. Therefore this guide will offer long-term planning tips for first-years, and will point out the discrepancies between Double Degree policy and standard Barnard/JTS policy for sophomores and juniors. Both Dean Young (Barnard) and Dean Grabiner (JTS) are very familiar with their respective school’s study abroad policies. Here is some useful information regarding study abroad policy for Double Degrees:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>You need at least 60 credits taken at Barnard during the normal school year, and at least 54 taken at JTS (during the year or during the summer). Abroad credits normally do not count toward these numbers. If the abroad program is sponsored by Columbia, then it will count toward the 60 at Barnard. (It will also count as one of your 3 full-time semesters!)</li>
		<li>Familiarize yourself with Barnard’s policy regarding language of instruction on abroad programs. If you want to go somewhere other than Israel, you will need to have a certain level of proficiency the language spoken in the country where you want to go.</li>
		<li>You should start talking to Dean Young and Dean Grabiner at least 2 full semesters before you plan to go abroad. If you’re not sure when you want to go, be in touch with them fall sophomore year so that it’s on everyone’s radar. Even if you’re not sure whether you’re going to go abroad, mention it to both of your academic advisors as soon as possible.</li>
		<li>It’s very important for Double Degrees to figure out what they want to study while they’re abroad early. Depending on your individual circumstances (AP credit, gap year credit, summer plans, Hebrew level, major, etc.), your study abroad plans may leave you way ahead credits-wise at one school or the other. For example, if you are planning on going on a program where there is no Jewish studies, and you don’t need JTS elective credit, you might need to take extra JTS courses so that you are on track at both schools when you get back. This might be in the semesters before you go, or during a minimester/summer session before you go.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Special Policies for Double Degree Students</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Most Barnard students fill out a form on ebear called the “Notice of Study Leave”. DO NOT DO THIS. Double Degrees instead fill out a form called “Domestic Study Leave”. This form is not on ebear. What it means is on paper you will be enrolled at JTS only during your abroad semester. Instead of paying full-time Barnard tuition for your semester abroad, you will pay a $125 fee to Barnard to keep your name in the system, and follow JTS’ study abroad policy instead. JTS’ study abroad policy is that you register on myJTS as “study abroad” during program filing. There is a small fee you pay to JTS, and you pay tuition for the abroad program to the program directly. This saves thousands of dollars!
			<ul>
				<li>If you are on financial aid, I do not know how this policy affects your eligibility for financial aid. It is possible that the cost of the program you want to participate in is less than what you pay now. If so, I would double check that your package won’t be affected when you return. If not, I would suggest talking to Dean Young about following the procedure other Barnard students use. The “Notice of Study Leave” and policy of paying Barnard full tuition is specifically so that financial aid packages are not affected by study abroad.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Kashrut/Shabbat: If kashrut/Shabbat are important to you, I would highly recommend contacting the program you are interested in directly to find out what sort of Jewish community might exist near the program.</li>
		<li>(If you don’t already) it’s worth considering living in JTS housing the semester that you’re not abroad because it might be easier to arrange. This will not affect your Barnard housing guarantee the following year.</li>
		<li>If you receive financial aid, always check how your package will be affected before making a change like this</li>

	<h3>More Tips</h3>

	<p><span class="bold">Plan ahead.</span> Meet with your deans at program planning time, and make it clear to them what your requirements are. They are there to help you, and they will be thrilled to create an organized plan. Tell them whether or not you are ok studying over a summer, if/when/where you want to go abroad, and what credits you are counting from AP or gap year programs. Each time you meet with your advisor, review your plan and make sure you are on track to meet your expectations.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Take things you like</span>, or are at least interested in. You will work harder, be happier, and do better. Sometimes that does not work out 100%, but it’s worth it to at least try.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Diversify.</span> Take a mixture of lecture courses, seminars, PE, etc. We have lots of requirements and they are all a little bit different so there is room to play around. Try to work it out so that you have a few classes that will be reading heavy, a few that will have essays, a few that will have exams. That way, even when you have a lot of work it’s all different and you won’t feel overwhelmed by an endless to-do list of the same tasks.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Look at the List.</span> There is a list of classes that meet all of the nine ways of knowing. Look there for things you think sound cool and fill some requirement you have left, and then read the course descriptions. This list is usually posted on eBear.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Be adventurous.</span> College is a time to take classes that you will otherwise never have the chance to learn about. Try out Opera as Literature or Dance in New York City. Chances are, even those crazy classes will fit some requirement, so you’ll end up having fun and checking off a requirement.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Shop.</span> It can be hard to go to a bunch of classes in the first week of school but if you can swing it it really is a good idea. This will ensure that you don’t get stuck in a really awful class. Just try to limit this to the first week, try to have a plan by the second meeting of each class.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Ask.</span> If something doesn’t go your way, like getting blocked out of a class or having a schedule conflict, ask for help fixing it. Be polite and professional, and explain what you need and what is standing in your way. Be ready to accept “no” for an answer, but it can’t hurt to ask.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">Be an optimist.</span> This is a difficult program and there will be times when part of your schedule doesn’t go your way. Try to still find something valuable to learn from the class. And if you don’t, there’s always the pass/fail option!</p>
