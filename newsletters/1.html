				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHey summer breakers! Presidential campaigns are well underway (the election is next year, right?), Jon Stewart is going off the air tonight, and New York has never felt more humid, you know what that means...the 2015-2016 academic year is right around the corner! If anyone was wondering if Butler is less crowded during the summer, I've been checking Density, and it's not. Who's surprised?<br><br>

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut let's get serious, welcome to the first issue of The LCSC Dispatch! This is LCSC's NEW bi-weekly newsletter designed to keep you up to date on everything LCSC, particularly what's going on behind the scenes. While you've been out in the world vacationing, working your summer jobs, and basking in the glory of 4 months of no exams, LCSC has been innovating the ways in which we reach you and you reach us. We're committed to fostering a strong sense of community and peoplehood at List College, and encouraging student dialogue revolving policy changes, and anything else you need to make this experience as fulfilling as possible. Here's a breakdown of the new features and upgrades that are now available to all List College students:<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA new website! Packed with everything you need to know to navigate this experience including events around campus, a full calendar of the LCSC schedule, awesome activities to do in New York City, resources for List College, Columbia, and Barnard, and helpful guides to help you navigate this complex program.<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNew and improved social media outlets to make sure you don't miss a thing. These include reimagined ways to use our Facebook pages:<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. Our closed "Albert A. List College Group" will be used for events so that everyone is automatically invited, and for students to post about anything they feel like voicing!<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. Like our "List College Student Council" page to get status updates from LCSC. Here's where we'll keep you notified with updates such as: when a new issue of The LCSC Dispatch is posted, policy discussion threads, and more!<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe're also on Twitter! Follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/ListCollegeSC">@ListCollegeSC</a> to get quick updates on events around campus, live tweets from LCSC meetings about policy discussions, fun facts about List College, and random quotes from around Morningside Heights.<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFollow our Instagram <a href="http://instagram.com/listcollegesc?ref=badge" target="_blank">@ListCollegeSC</a>! See photos from around campus, and check out our #SpotlightSunday which will feature a List College student every week and the amazing things that they are doing! (Note: students who don't partake in the Instagram hype can see every other #SpotlightSunday featured in The LCSC Dispatch)<br><br><br>
