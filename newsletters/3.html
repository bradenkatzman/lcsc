				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIT’S DIVESTMENT TIME! This week, List College Student Council passed a monumental measure to pursue divestment from fossil fuels at JTS. What does this mean? It means that JTS’s endowment - money or other financial assets that are used for investments - has investments in companies that are engaged in the extraction of fossil fuels. These fuels, when burned, cause drastic global warming and LCSC is joining in the fight for climate justice.<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat was a lot of information, so we’re going to do three things to make this simpler:<br><br>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Here’s a quick breakdown of the fossil fuel cycle:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Oil companies extract prehistoric biological matter from the ground that has turned into oil from heat emanating from the core and extreme pressure.</li>
							<li>These companies sell oil for use in factories, transportation, and much more and make huge profits while disregarding climate and social justice.</li>
							<li>When the oil is burned, it releases Carbon Dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. This CO2 accumulates and works to trap sun heat and rays, thereby warming the earth drastically in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" target="_blank">The Greenhouse Gas Effect</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Fossil Fuel Information, Divestment Goals, and an Online Petition are now available on <a href="http://lcsconline.com/divestment.html" target="_blank">THE NEW DIVESTMENT PAGE!</a></strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Our progress tracker will show you what we’ve accomplished, and what’s to come!</li>
							<li>All the information and research you need to understand climate change and why we need to divest is available at your fingertips</li>
							<li>Sign our petition to join our voice in saying NO to fossil fuels</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Divestment Community Forum</strong><br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the coming days, LCSC committee applications will be released. The NEW Divestment Committee will be a task force working with LCSC and the student body to head this campaign. The first task of the committee is to plan a COMMUNITY FORUM! We’ll use this as a way to tell you more about divestment, answer questions, and tell you how to get involved!
