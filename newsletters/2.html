				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWelcome back, List College! The first day of the 2015-2016 academic year is officially in the books. We’re excited to be ushering in a new era of the Joint Program where all on-campus Joint Program students are living “Under One Roof.” LCSC had the privilege of spending NSOP with all of the first-year students at List College and the relationships that we saw form reminded us of the amazing sense of Kehillah, or community, at List College. The first-year class is packed full of amazing people from all over the United States and the globe, and the perspectives and attitudes that they bring to List College are among the best we’ve ever seen. We are so happy to be welcoming them into our community and can’t wait to see the growth and transformation that our community will undergo as they become vital members of the List College family.<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOrientation was packed with fun activities from a wild but successful move in day to a scavenger hunt in New York City that ended with a ferry ride to see the Statue of Liberty on the Staten Island Ferry (which is FREE, by the way!). It was great to experience orientation as students who had already been in the shoes of the first-years, which felt like ages ago! Hearing Dean Schwartz’s and Dean Harford’s speeches at the Welcome Lunch with parents reminded us of just how amazing these institutions are and how lucky we are to be learning in this vibrant society. We hope that List College students, and all students in our community, realize the opportunities we’ve earned and use our fortune to give back where we can; join a local organization that helps collect food for the homeless, give tzedakah when you can, or participate in Tikkun Olam projects.  If you have an idea or want to talk to an LCSC representative about this, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us! Our community is strong and can make a serious impact when we work together.<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere’s a list of LCSC events happening this month (as always, more details and RSVP information are available on the website at lcsconline.com):
				<ul>
					<li>Welcome Back Event - Wednesday September 16, 7:30PM, Goldsmith Moadon<br>RSVP: https://www.facebook.com/events/1702163860013374/</li>

				</ul>
				These are the policy issues that we’re currently working on for List College students:
				<ul>
					<li>Printer Paper available in the Moadon</li>
					<li>No class meetings for 11:40AM classes on JTS Days of Learning that only run until 12:00PM</li>
				</ul>
				The more we maintain a dialogue about these policies, the stronger our voice is!
